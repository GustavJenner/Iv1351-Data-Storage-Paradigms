Repository for Data Storage Paradigms
Translate the conceptual model from task one into the same kind of model that was created in the lecture on logical and physical models, that is a logical model with enough physical aspects to enable creating a database. You are allowed to change the conceptual model if you discover flaws, but only change if it is necessary. The model that is created must cover the entire description of the Soundgood music school company in section one above. The diagram must be made in a crow foot notation (for example IE notation). Also create a database based on the model, the database must be exactly as described in the model. If you discover flaws when creating the database, and want to change it, also the model must be changed. You are advised to also look at tasks three and four already now, to get an understanding of how your database will be used. Below follows guidelines for what shall be written in the report.
